# SFM - Suckless File Manager

A little file manager I made.

To compile you need the following libraries installed:
- Curses
- Boost Filesystem

If so, run the following command to compile:
``` sh
make
```

And the following to install:
``` sh
sudo make install
```

To uninstall just type:
```sh
sudo make uninstall
```
